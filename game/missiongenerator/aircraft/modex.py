"""Squadron-sequenced board numbers (modex) for Hornets and Tomcats.

pydcs assigns every aircraft's ``onboard_num`` by popping from an *unordered*
set (``Country.next_onboard_num`` -> ``set.pop()``), so board numbers come out
as random three-digit values. Navy jets don't wear random numbers: the air
wing gives each squadron a modex block (100, 200, 300, ...) and numbers the
squadron's jets sequentially inside it -- the first jet X00, the second X01,
the third X02.

:class:`ModexAllocator` pre-assigns one block per Hornet/Tomcat squadron at
construction (per coalition, in air-wing order, Tomcats ahead of Hornets --
the traditional CVW fighter blocks) and re-stamps every generated unit of
those squadrons with the next number in its squadron's sequence, in
generation order: tasked flights first, then the untasked ramp aircraft. The
campaign does not model individual airframes, so numbering is per-mission
(deterministic within a mission, not sticky to a pilot across turns). Every other airframe keeps the stock pydcs number.

A player may pin a flight's board number on the payload tab
(``Flight.board_number``, the lead's number; wingmen follow in order). Pinned
numbers are claimed per coalition before anything is stamped: the flight wears
them on any airframe, the squadron sequences skip them, and a random pydcs
number that lands on one is re-rolled, so no other package wears it.
